## Project Description

The Netflix movies and shows dataset contains information on all the titles available on Netflix as of 2019. This project aims to answer some key questions about the dataset, such as:

- What are the most common genres on Netflix?
- Which countries produce the most content?
- Which actors and directors have the most titles on Netflix?
- What is the average length of a movie on Netflix?
- How has the amount of content on Netflix changed over time?

To answer these questions, the project performs data cleaning and preparation, and then uses Python data analytics tools such as pandas and matplotlib to analyze the data.

## Installation

To use this project, you will need to have Python 3.x installed, as well as the following libraries:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- numpy

You can install these libraries using pip. For example:

- pip install pandas
- pip install matplotlib
- pip install numpy

Once you have installed the required libraries, you can download the project code and datasets from the GitHub repository.

## Usage

To use the project, simply run the Python script `main.ipynb`. This script performs the data cleaning and preparation, and then generates visualizations to answer the key questions about the dataset.

You can customize the script to answer additional questions, or to perform additional data cleaning and preparation if necessary.
